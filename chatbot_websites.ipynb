All fruit offer health benefits, so include as much variety as possible.\\n\\n“An apple a day keeps the doctor away,” or so the saying goes.\\n\\nHealthcare professionals know that fruit is a highly nutritious, delicious, and convenient addition to any diet. With more than 2,000 varieties of fruit available, you may wonder which ones you should pick.\\n\\nEach type of fruit brings its own unique set of nutrients and benefits to the table. The key is to eat fruits of various colors, as each color provides adifferent set of healthy nutrients (1Trusted Source).\\n\\nHere are the top 20 healthiest fruits to enjoy on a regular basis.\\n\\nShare on Pinterest\\n\\n1. Apples\\n\\nOne of the most popular fruits, apples are chock-full of nutrition.\\n\\nThey’re rich in both soluble and insoluble fiber, such as pectin, hemicellulose, and cellulose. These help you manage your blood sugar levels, promote good digestion, and support gut and heart health (2Trusted Source, 3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source).\\n\\nIn addition, they’re a good source of vitamin C and plant polyphenols, which are disease-fighting compounds found in plants. In fact, consuming apples regularly may lower your risk of heart disease, stroke, cancer, overweight, obesity, and neurological disorders (3Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source).\\n\\nNote that most of the polyphenols in apples are located just below the skin, so be sure to eat it to reap the greatest benefits.\\n\\nHow to Peel: Apples\\n\\nHow to Peel Apples: A Quick and Easy GuideWatch this video to learn quick and easy ways to peel an apple.0 seconds of 1 minute, 16 secondsVolume 0%Press shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcutsKeyboard ShortcutsEnabledDisabledShortcuts Open/Close/ or ?Play/PauseSPACEIncrease Volume↑Decrease Volume↓Seek Forward→Seek Backward←Captions On/OffcFullscreen/Exit FullscreenfMute/UnmutemDecrease Caption Size-Increase Caption Size+ or =Seek %0-9\\n             \\n            \\n            \\n        SettingsOffCaptionsFont ColorundefinedFont Opacity100%Font Size100%Font FamilyundefinedCharacter EdgeNoneBackground ColorBlackBackground Opacity75%Window ColorBlackWindow Opacity0%ResetWhiteBlackRedGreenBlueYellowMagentaCyan100%75%50%25%200%175%150%125%100%75%50%ArialCourierGeorgiaImpactLucida ConsoleTahomaTimes New RomanTrebuchet MSVerdanaNoneRaisedDepressedUniformDrop ShadowWhiteBlackRedGreenBlueYellowMagentaCyan100%75%50%25%0%WhiteBlackRedGreenBlueYellowMagentaCyan100%75%50%25%0% facebook twitter Email Linkhttps://cdn.jwplayer.com/previews/4eSORUDDCopiedAuto180p1080p720p406p270p180p\\n            \\n                \\n                    \\n                    \\n                    \\n                \\n            \\n        Live00:0001:1601:16\\n\\n2. Blueberries\\n\\nBlueberries are well known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.\\n\\nIn particular, they’re high in anthocyanin, a plant pigment and flavonoid that gives blueberries their characteristic blue-purple color. This compound helps fight cell-damaging free radicals that can lead to disease (8Trusted Source).\\n\\n8Trusted Source\\n\\n9Trusted Source\\n\\n10Trusted Source\\n\\n11Trusted Source\\n\\n12Trusted Source\\n\\n13Trusted Source\\n\\nFor example, a study including over 200,000 participants observed a 5% decrease in the risk of type 2 diabetes for every 17 grams of anthocyanin-rich berries they consumed per day (14Trusted Source).\\n\\nOther berries high in anthocyanins include blackberries, bilberry, elderberry, cherries, and chokeberries (8Trusted Source).\\n\\n3. Bananas\\n\\nThe benefits of bananas go beyond their potassium content. Along with providing 7% of the Daily Value (DV) for potassium, bananas contain (15Trusted Source):\\n\\nVitamin B6: 27% of the DV\\n\\nVitamin C: 12% of the DV\\n\\nMagnesium: 8% of the DV\\n\\nIn addition, they offer a wide variety of plant compounds called polyphenols and phytosterols, both of which support your overall health. Furthermore, they’re high in prebiotics, a type of fiber that promotes the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut (16Trusted Source, 17Trusted Source, 18Trusted Source, 19Trusted Source).\\n\\nNote that green, unripe bananas are higher in resistant starch than ripe ones, and they’re a good source of the dietary fiber pectin. Both of these have been linked to a number of health benefits, including improved blood sugar control and better digestive health (20, 21Trusted Source).\\n\\nMeanwhile, ripe bananas are an excellent source of easily digested carbs, making them great to fuel up on before a workout (22Trusted Source, 23Trusted Source).\\n\\n4. Oranges\\n\\nOranges are known for their high vitamin C content, providing 91% of the DV in a single fruit. They’re also high in potassium, folate, thiamine (vitamin B1), fiber, and plant polyphenols (24Trusted Source).\\n\\nStudies have found that consuming whole oranges may lower levels of inflammation, blood pressure, cholesterol, and post-meal blood sugar (24Trusted Source, 25Trusted Source).\\n\\nThough 100% orange juice provides a high volume of nutrients and antioxidants, it usually lacks dietary fiber. Varieties that include the pulp do include some fiber, so opt for these over juices without pulp.\\n\\nThat said, try to eat whole oranges more often, and keep juice portions to 1 cup (235 mL) or less per serving.\\n\\n5. Dragon fruit\\n\\nAlso known as pitaya or pitahaya, dragon fruit is rich in many nutrients, including fiber, iron, magnesium, and vitamins C and E. It’s also an excellent source of carotenoids, such as lycopene and beta carotene (26Trusted Source).\\n\\nPeople in Southeast Asian cultures have regarded dragon fruit highly for hundreds of years as a health-promoting fruit. Over recent decades, it has gained popularity in Western countries (26Trusted Source).\\n\\n6. Mango\\n\\nShare on Pinterest\\n\\nKnown as the “king of fruits,” mangoes are an excellent source of potassium, folate, fiber, and vitamins A, C, B6, E, and K. They’re also rich in numerous plant polyphenols that have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties (27Trusted Source).\\n\\nIn particular, mangoes are high in mangiferin, a potent antioxidant. Studies have shown it may protect the body from chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and certain forms of cancer (28Trusted Source, 29Trusted Source, 30Trusted Source).\\n\\nWhat’s more, mangoes contain fiber, which helps support regular bowel movements and aids digestive health (31Trusted Source).\\n\\n7. Avocado\\n\\nUnlike most other fruits, avocados are high in healthy fats and low in natural sugars.\\n\\nThey’re mostly made of oleic acid, a monounsaturated fat linked to better heart health. They also contain high amounts of potassium, fiber, vitamin B6, folate, vitamins E and K, and two carotenoids known as lutein and zeaxanthin, which support eye health (32Trusted Source, 33Trusted Source, 34Trusted Source).\\n\\nIn fact, a high quality 2020 study found a significant decrease in cholesterol levels and an increase in blood lutein levels among participants who consumed an avocado per day for 5 weeks (35Trusted Source).\\n\\nWhen compared by weight, avocados are higher in calories than most other fruits. However, studies have linked them to better weight management. Researchers have proposed that this is because their high fat and fiber contents promote fullness (33Trusted Source, 36Trusted Source, 37Trusted Source).\\n\\n8. Lychee\\n\\nLychee, which is also known as litchi and Chinese cherry, is packed with nutrition.\\n\\nIn particular, it’s a rich source of vitamin C, potassium, fiber, and many polyphenols with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. These include (38Trusted Source, 39Trusted Source):\\n\\ngallic acid\\n\\nchlorogenic acid\\n\\ncatechins\\n\\ncaffeic acid\\n\\nOne serving of lychee is around seven small individual fruits.\\n\\n9. Pineapple\\n\\nPineapple is one of the most popular tropical fruits.\\n\\nOne cup (165 grams) of pineapple provides 88% of the DV for vitamin C and 73% of the DV for manganese (40Trusted Source).\\n\\nManganese supports metabolism and blood sugar regulation and acts as an antioxidant (41Trusted Source, 42Trusted Source).\\n\\nPineapple also contains a number of polyphenolic compounds that have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties (41Trusted Source, 43Trusted Source).\\n\\nAdditionally, pineapple contains an enzyme known as bromelain, which people commonly use to tenderize meats. Anecdotal sources also claim this enzyme may support digestion, though there’s limited research on this (41Trusted Source).\\n\\n10. Strawberries\\n\\nShare on Pinterest\\n\\nStrawberries are a favorite fruit for many. They’re delicious, convenient, and highly nutritious. In particular, strawberries are a good source of vitamin C, folate, and manganese (44Trusted Source).\\n\\nThey’re full of plant polyphenols that act as antioxidants, such as flavonoids, phenolic acids, lignans, and tannins.\\n\\nIn particular, they’re high in anthocyanins, ellagitannins, and proanthocyanidins, which studies have shown reduce the risk of chronic disease (45Trusted Source, 46Trusted Source, 47Trusted Source).\\n\\nFurthermore, they have a low glycemic index, meaning they won’t significantly affect your blood sugar levels (45Trusted Source, 46Trusted Source, 47Trusted Source).\\n\\n11. Durian\\n\\nThough known for its pungent smell, durian is incredibly nutritious.\\n\\nA single cup (243 grams) provides:\\n\\nFiber: 9 grams\\n\\nPotassium: 23% of the DV\\n\\nManganese: 34% of the DV\\n\\nVitamin C: 53% of the DV\\n\\nVitamin B6: 45% of the DV\\n\\nThiamine (vitamin B1): 76% of the DV\\n\\nIt also contains plenty of other B vitamins, copper, folate, and magnesium (48Trusted Source).\\n\\nWhat’s more, it’s rich in plant polyphenols, including (49Trusted Source, 50Trusted Source):\\n\\nflavonoids such as anthocyanins\\n\\nphenolic acids such as cinnamic acid\\n\\ntannins\\n\\nother beneficial plant compounds such as carotenoids\\n\\nIt’s also a high source of potassium and fiber, both of which contribute to good heart health. Finally, durian pulp has probiotic effects, which may support healthy gut diversity (49Trusted Source, 50Trusted Source).\\n\\n12. Cherries\\n\\nCherries are a great source of fiber and potassium, both of which are important for heart and gut health (51Trusted Source, 52Trusted Source, 53Trusted Source).\\n\\nThey’re also high in antioxidant plant compounds, such as anthocyanins and hydroxycinnamates, which help protect the body from oxidative stress.\\n\\nFurthermore, they’re a good source of serotonin, tryptophan, and melatonin, which support good mood and sleep (52Trusted Source).\\n\\n13. Olives\\n\\nThough they may not readily come to mind when you think of fruit, olives are a great addition to your diet.\\n\\nThey’re an excellent source of vitamin E, copper, and a monounsaturated fat called oleic acid.\\n\\nThey’re also rich in plant polyphenols, such as oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol, and quercetin, which have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties (54Trusted Source, 55Trusted Source, 56Trusted Source).\\n\\nIn fact, whole olives and olive oil make up a large component of the Mediterranean diet, which studies have shown may lower the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, cognitive decline, overweight, and obesity (55Trusted Source, 56Trusted Source, 57Trusted Source, 58Trusted Source).\\n\\n14. Watermelon\\n\\nShare on Pinterest\\n\\nWatermelon is a highly nutritious summer favorite. It’s an abundant source of antioxidants, such as vitamins A and C, beta carotene, and lycopene. It’s also a good source of potassium and magnesium (59Trusted Source).\\n\\nIn particular, watermelon is one of the top sources of lycopene, a carotenoid that gives watermelon its pink-red color.\\n\\nA diet high in lycopene is linked to lower levels of oxidative stress and inflammation. The nutrient may also decrease the risk of heart disease, cancer, and type 2 diabetes (60Trusted Source, 61Trusted Source, 62Trusted Source).\\n\\nInterestingly, lycopene and beta carotene may also provide minor skin protection from ultraviolet (UV) rays, reduce the risk of sunburns, and help your skin heal faster (63Trusted Source, 64Trusted Source, 65Trusted Source).\\n\\nThat said, you’ll still need to use sunscreen to keep your skin fully protected (63Trusted Source, 64Trusted Source, 65Trusted Source).\\n\\nFinally, watermelon has a uniquely high water content. A single wedge (434 grams) provides 13.4 ounces (395 mL) of water. Since it’s high in both water and potassium, it can help hydrate and replenish electrolytes after a workout or on a hot summer day (59Trusted Source).\\n\\n15. Kiwi\\n\\nAlso known as the Chinese gooseberry, kiwi is great for your health.\\n\\nIt’s high in vitamin C and a good source of fiber, potassium, folate, and vitamin E. It’s also a good source of carotenoids, including lutein, zeaxanthin, and beta carotene, which support eye health and become more dominant as fruits ripen (66Trusted Source, 67Trusted Source).\\n\\nFurthermore, people have used it in traditional Chinese medicine for hundreds of years to support gut health and digestion.\\n\\nThese benefits are due to its soluble and insoluble fiber, polyphenols, and digestive enzymes such as actinidin (66Trusted Source, 67Trusted Source).\\n\\nOne small study showed that consuming 2 kiwis daily for 3 days increased stool frequency and softened stool, suggesting it may help treat mild constipation (68Trusted Source).\\n\\n16. Peaches\\n\\nPeaches are another summer favorite. They’re a good source of potassium, fiber, and vitamins A, C, and E. They also contain the carotenoids lutein, zeaxanthin, and beta carotene (69Trusted Source).\\n\\nWhile the flesh and skin are both nutritious, the skin contains higher amounts of antioxidants, which can help fight free radicals in your body. Therefore, make sure you eat the peach skin to reap the greatest health benefits (70Trusted Source, 71Trusted Source).\\n\\nFortunately, the nutrient content of peaches appears to be similar whether you consume them fresh or canned. However, if you opt for canned peaches, make sure they’re packed in water rather than sugary syrup (72Trusted Source).\\n\\n17. Guava\\n\\nGuava is a fantastic source of vitamin C. In fact, a single fruit (55 grams) provides 140% of the DV for this nutrient (73Trusted Source).\\n\\nAlong with this, guava contains some of the highest amounts of lycopene compared with other lycopene-rich foods like tomatoes, watermelon, and grapefruit (73Trusted Source, 74).\\n\\nIt’s also a high source of other antioxidants, such as beta carotene and various flavonoids (73Trusted Source, 74).\\n\\nBecause guava is so high in nutrients and antioxidants, consuming it regularly may support the health of your eyes, heart, kidneys, and skin (74).\\n\\nIt may likewise protect against chronic diseases and support a healthy immune system (74).\\n\\n18. Grapes\\n\\nGrapes are convenient, healthy, and particularly high in potassium and vitamin K, which both support heart health.\\n\\nThey’re a rich source of beneficial plant compounds that have been linked to numerous health benefits, such as a lowered risk of heart disease and certain types of cancer. These compounds include (75Trusted Source, 76Trusted Source):\\n\\nresveratrol\\n\\nanthocyanins\\n\\ncaffeic acid\\n\\nquercetin\\n\\nkaempferol\\n\\nWhile all varieties of grapes provide benefits, red and purple grapes have the highest antioxidant content. In particular, they produce purple-red pigments called anthocyanins, which have been linked to better heart and brain health (8Trusted Source, 76Trusted Source).\\n\\n19. Pomegranates\\n\\nPomegranates are known for their high antioxidant content.\\n\\nThey contain a lengthy list of beneficial plant compounds, such as flavonoids, tannins, and lignans. These have strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that help fight free radicals and reduce your risk of chronic disease (77Trusted Source, 78Trusted Source, 78Trusted Source, 80Trusted Source).\\n\\nOne high quality study found that people experienced significantly lower levels of inflammation after drinking 8.5 ounces (250 mL) of pomegranate juice per day for 12 weeks, compared with a placebo (81Trusted Source).\\n\\n20. Grapefruit\\n\\nShare on Pinterest\\n\\nGrapefruit is one of the healthiest citrus fruits. It’s packed with vitamin C, potassium, fiber, and beta carotene, which your body converts into vitamin A.\\n\\nIn an observational study including 12,789 people, grapefruit consumption was linked to higher levels of HDL (good) cholesterol and lower body weight, waist circumference, body mass index (BMI), triglycerides, and levels of inflammation (82Trusted Source).\\n\\nMoreover, regularly consuming grapefruit may aid weight management and promote heart health (83Trusted Source, 84Trusted Source, 85Trusted Source).\\n\\nThough grapefruit is highly nutritious, some of its compounds can lessen or alter the effectiveness of certain medications. Talk with your healthcare professional about whether you can eat grapefruit if you’re taking:\\n\\nstatins\\n\\ncalcium channel blockers\\n\\ncorticosteroids\\n\\nimmunosuppressants\\n\\nanti-anxiety medications\\n\\nIn these cases, you may have to avoid grapefruit (86Trusted Source).\\n\\nThe bottom line\\n\\nMany delicious and nutritious fruits can help ensure good health.\\n\\nWhile this list provides 20 of the most nutritious fruits, there are many others you can choose from.\\n\\nTo reap the greatest benefits, be sure to eat a variety of colorful fruits on a daily basis.\\n\\nLast medically reviewed on  May 10, 2021\\n\\nHow we reviewed this article:\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nOur experts continually monitor the health and wellness space, and we update our articles when new information becomes available.\\n\\nCurrent Version\\n\\nFeb 26, 2023\\n\\nWritten By\\n\\nKatey Davidson, MScFN, RD, CPT\\n\\nEdited By\\n\\nStephanie Orford\\n\\nMay 10, 2021\\n\\nWritten By\\n\\nKatey Davidson, MScFN, RD, CPT\\n\\nEdited By\\n\\nStephanie Orford\\n\\nMedically Reviewed By\\n\\nSade Meeks, MS, RD\\n\\nCopy Edited By\\n\\nChristina Guzik, BA, MBA\\n\\nShare this article\\n\\nMedically reviewed by Sade Meeks, MS, RD, Nutrition —\\n\\nWritten by Katey Davidson, MScFN, RD, CPT —\\n\\nUpdated on February 26, 2023\\n\\nRead this next\\n\\n13 of the Least Healthy Fruits: Sugar, Diabetes, and MoreWritten by Rachael Ajmera, MS, RDAlthough fruit is highly nutritious and associated with many health benefits, some types are high in sugar and calories.
