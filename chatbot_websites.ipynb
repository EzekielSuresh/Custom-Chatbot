       "[Document(page_content=\"Quick Guidelines for Interns at Dell Technologies\\n\\nReport this article\\n\\nGhita Chenchar\\n\\nGhita Chenchar\\n\\nTalent Magnet @ Dell Technologies- Embracing Diversity for Workplace Success\\n\\nPublished Mar 1, 2017\\n\\n+ Follow\\n\\nThousands of undergraduates and graduates around the world are eager to find an effective internship in their field of study. One of the most common graduation requirements is the final end-of-year project where work experience may be required. Moreover, to build a good resume, you should start as an intern to make your initial step in the working environment. Nonetheless, the “word-of-mouth” effect leads to fear a position as an intern. In other words, when you hear this term, it is usually followed by making copies, brewing coffee etc…\\n\\nThe good news is that at Dell Technologies, interns are treated in a completely different way. Within this company, you will gain the necessary knowledge to grow in a corporate environment and be part of many significant projects. Not only will you come across many different cultures, but you will also network with people from different levels. Additionally, your team will be always at your disposal to resolve any issues.\\n\\nIf you are a fresh intern joining our company, please keep on reading. If you are already an intern, then you may identify yourself with some of these guidelines. If you are none of them, then short reading will do you no harm.\\n\\n#1 A Notebook is a Necessity\\n\\nDuring day one, you will get to know your team, your desk, your system access etc. You may even start doing some job shadowing. Thus, your brain might encounter an information overload, and you won’t be able to keep everything in mind. Therefore, I strongly urge you to keep a notebook with you in order to write down all the important data.\\n\\n#2 MyDell, Smac, IM, MR, Req…? :O\\n\\nDon’t freak out, we use plenty of acronyms and abbreviations as our time is very valuable. At Dell Technologies, there are plenty of tools that you will use to understand how the process works. We usually use these acronyms that most of us can relate to, which make us feel a little bit like FBI agents (please focus on the “LITTLE BIT”). For instance, IM stands for instant messaging and is our internal way to communicate with each other more efficiently and allows us to save time instead of sending emails. Indeed, only time and practice will help you learn these abbreviations quickly.\\n\\n#3 ERG? What is it?\\n\\nERG stands for Employee Resource Groups. The goal of these groups is to gather employees sharing the same interest such as community, ethics, gender equality, lifestyle etc. They lead their people to grow professionally and personally by creating a sense of volunteering and belonging to a specific group of people. For instance, “Planet” aims at contributing to environmental protection, “Wise” empowers women to grow and be future leaders, and “GenNext” promotes networking for young professionals. It is very important to join one of these ERGs, as it will help you network within the company and grow your career.\\n\\n#4 University Relations Events\\n\\nToday, more than 25% of our external hiring is made up of fresh graduates who are part of the University Relations Program, more commonly known as UR (yes, another acronym). If you are hired as an intern, then you do fall under the UR program, which makes you stand out. You are given more opportunities to meet people just like you within the work environment and develop a strong career path while having fun. Our recruiters organize many events throughout the year for you to build up your individual development plan and get continual learning and training. Make sure you attend all the UR events.\\n\\nLike\\n\\nLike\\n\\nCelebrate\\n\\nSupport\\n\\nLove\\n\\nInsightful\\n\\nFunny\\n\\nComment\\n\\nCopy\\n\\nLinkedIn\\n\\nFacebook\\n\\nTwitter\\n\\nShare\\n\\n11\\n\\n1
